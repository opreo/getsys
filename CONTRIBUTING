# contributing

this wasn't a major consideration of ours; **if you want to chip in your knowledge, feel free to!** (we have no idea what we're doing lol)

**we welcome the refinement of any logic**, or even the **implementation of new modules that can pull just about anything** about a computer system!

however, **please note the following**, if you do intend to contribute:

  - we like **LF (Linux-style) line endings**; this isn't strict here, given how tiny this project is, but please keep this in mind if you know what this means.

  - **all-lowercase lettering is a stylistic choice**; of course, you may use caps in your syntax, but the likes of comments should not be capitalised under any circumstance.

  - as such, we like snake case naming rather than camel case naming. this is the style typical of python variable names, like '`my_identifier`' rather than '`myIdentifier`'.

obviously, **these aren't strict** given how tiny this project is right now.

these are just **foundational guidelines we like to establish** when starting something new to help keep things clean, coordinated, and, most importantly, **in sync with other projects** in our family, which are to **more strictly follow these same guidelines**.

of course, **we would appreciate any and all civil, constructive contributions**, **they would help us learn and grow**!

**thank you so much in advance!!** :))
